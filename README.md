## Features
- **Customizable Durations**: Set your desired focus, short break, and long break times.
- **Session Alerts**: Get alert messages at the end of each focus session, short break, and long break.
- **Pause & Resume**: Pause the timer at any time and resume later.
- **Reset Button**: Reset everything back to the initial settings (25 minutes focus, 5 minutes short break, 30 minutes long break).
- **Tomato Icon**: Custom tomato favicon to remind you of the Pomodoro Technique.

## How to Use
1. Set your desired focus, short break, and long break times.
2. Press "Start" to begin the focus session.
3. When the focus session ends, the timer automatically switches to a short break (or long break after 4 sessions).
4. Alerts guide you through each transition.
5. Pause, resume, or reset the timer as needed.

## How It Works
The Pomodoro timer starts with a customizable focus session. After each focus session, a short break begins automatically. Once four focus sessions are completed, a longer break begins. You will be alerted at the end of every session with a message and guided to the next step.

The timer also provides the ability to pause, resume, or reset everything to the default settings (25 minutes focus, 5 minutes short break, and 30 minutes long break).
